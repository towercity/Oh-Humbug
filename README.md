# Oh, Humbug
## Frogger style gameplay clone

A gameplay clone of the classic arcade game frogger. Your goal is to cross the inexplicably bug filled sidewalk and douse yourself in the cool, clear waters of the canal.

You also have the option to collect green gems that, like the bugs, appear for no reason at all. These gems give you points, which are also cleared in the cool, clear waters of the canal.

##Installation

Simply download or clone the repository and open index.html to play.

## Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to move about the screen.

## Changes to implement in future updates

- Add looping music, and tones for movement, collision, and collection of gems
- Update art assets to fit a more off-kilter aesthetic
- Make the grid size smaller
- Lengthen the trip to the canal
- Add moving platforms, like the logs in frogger
